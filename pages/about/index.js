            <h2>Hi, I&apos;m Matt Jackson.</h2>
            <p>
              I decided to make a blog and track my interests, hobbies and
              professional development online. It will be kind of like a journal
              for me. I have never been very good at keeping a journal, but I
              have enjoyed typing away and tracking things digitally. They say
              digital journals aren&apos;t as effective because when your device
              is closed, your entire journal is out of site. That is true, but
              since I have a hard time writing anyways, it is better to have a
              digital conglomerate of all of my thoughts than to not have
              anything really documented or tracked at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a graduate from Utah Valley University. I never though I
              would go to college, simply because when I was young I was too
              occupied with being an entrepreneur and fashioning out business
              ideas in my head. That side of me has always stayed. But I did
              realize the powerful importance a professional education could
              bring me. I loved my time at UVU, and I made great friendships
              with my fellow classmates and even with many of the professors. I
              learned far more than I ever though I would. It is incredible,
              thinking back, how much those professionals at University taught
              me, as well as the co-students around me. I was blessed to go to
              school with bright students. And so watching them and interacting
              with them really helped me understand the power of design and
              development, and really inspired me to up my game.
            </p>
            <p>
              My major was something called Web Design and Development, Web and
              App Development. I always thought that was a long, kind of
              confusing title to understand. I primarily did coding and web
              development using different frameworks and technologies, but we
              did have quite a bit of UX / UI researching and design in the
              beginning years of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first I didn&apos;t know if I wanted to go down the design path
              or the development path. I chose development, because the major
              still offered an incredibly valuable amount of interaction design
              (which was the other emphasis), and I truly wanted to be able to
              create the things I designed. I love coding, I love the feeling of
              solving a puzzle all the while building a product that can be
              seen, used and shared and enjoyed by others.

            <h2>
              Exploring My Interests in Code, Modern Development Tooling and
              Production
            </h2>
            <p>
              I graduated in 2019, and was thinking hard about where I would go
              next in life and where I wanted my first experience in my career
              to be. I had it narrowed down between a full-time position,
              primarily using Laravel and Vue as technologies, and an internship
              for my church. Having an internship at a church might initially
              sound unimpressive, but my church has done an incredible job of
              creating one of the biggest and baddest technology production
              organizations in the world. They are always cranking out
              world-class code, design and media. They support over 16 million
              members around the globe, in almost every language. There is tons
              of localization and other real-world application experiences. And
              they also prioritize cutting-edge coding technology, such as
              Angular, React, AWS, Azure, etc.
            </p>
            I started out with an internship on a team with a global application
            in Angular. I had great conversations with my co-employees and
            learned a lot. My real passion kicked in when I went to a training.
            It was put on by the organization&apos;s internal React team. They
            started the meeting with a job opening they were looking to fill. It
            was for a Software Engineer 1 position on the React stack team. I
            applied literally during that meeting for that position, and felt an
            electric excitement about learning React in that environment, and
            joining the team that helped guide and direct all of React and
            JavaScript projects within the organization.
            <h2>Becoming Core in React and JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              I got called about an interview the following day. I brought my
              suit to work and dressed up for the interview. I met the stack
              team. They were very impressive, intelligent guys. I thought I had
              botched the interview because they coders around me were so
              advanced in JavaScript, and the world of technology in general.
              The next day I got a call from a Human Resources representative
              who said the Stack team liked me and was looking to hire me. I
              couldn&apos;t believe it, and of course I was stoked out of my
              mind about joining that team, and couldn&apos;t wait to tell my
              wife about it who was home, knowing I was waiting for a response
              about my interview.
            </p>
            <p>
              React, JavaScript and providing developer support (kind of like a
              help-desk for internal React and JavaScript questions) started
              right away. My environment for coding react was awesome. I made
              some really close friends on the Stack team (who are still friends
              today) who I loved talking about React and JavaScript with and who
              helped my understand the world of modern, large-scale application
              production. Not only did I gain lots of professional experience
              building myself as a React and JavaScript developer, but I had
              some interesting experiences as a teacher of those technologies
              too. The Stack Team provided trainings (similar to the one I first
              went to) in many different forms. I was able to give a
              presentation on Angular components at our yearly, two-day
              developer conference (attended by hundreds of developers). I also
              gave an hour-long presentation on how to implement our component
              library of React components. We had several complex components,
              and I showed how they worked, how to install them from NPM, and
              how to get the components working with data inside various
              applications in the organization. I loved being on the Stack Team,
              the people I met and where that brought me technically as a
              developer.
            </p>
            <h2>Software That Runs Golf Courses</h2>
            <p>
              My second job was in the sporting industry with a company called
              foreUP. They are a SaaS company that offers a software that runs
              golf course operations. It provided solutions for tee-time booking
              online, pre-paying, POS payment transactions inside the Pro Shop,
              restaurant management (splitting payments, running discounts and
              coupons), managing massive amounts of data for each course&apos;s
              customer profiles and membership / payment records.
            </p>
            <p>
              Projects I worked on included meticulous tracking of any updates
              made in the software by employees (a part of the application that
              course owners could see any updated information made by employees,
              what was changed, who changed it, etc), a feature that allowed
              courses to create and apply their own promotions (by setting
              specific promotion parameters based on time, dollar amount,
              percentage, etc), the newly-designed single sign-on feature (SSO)
              that leveraged Auth0 and would eventually become a main login
              screen for nearly all of the software users.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most of my time at foreUP, I was the only frontend developer
              on my team, and I handled implementing nearly all of the new
              software features and owned the frontend engineering and
              development on my team. I gained great experience in understanding
              technical requirements for the frontend based on a list of feature
              requirements from the project manager, as well as skills in
              talking with and collaborating with backend developers and
              designers who were working on the same project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also go a ton of golf in while working at foreUP. We went
              golfing as company at least once a year, we would go to Top Golf
              for fun, team-building activities, and since I was in the golf
              industry, I would practice and play by myself a lot trying to
              improve my game. I actually got my shots to be a lot more accurate
              and the game of golf became really enjoyable to me as a pass time
              and hobby. I looked for times when I could get out and practice
              golf, or go golfing with co-employees who wanted to set it up. We
              didn&apos;t get free tee times at golf courses, we still have to
              pay 100% of the tee time price and book as any other golf-course
              goer, but that was good for supporting the industry and making
              sure our relationship with courses was well-defined, respected and
              positive.

              Finding, Developing and Cultivating My Vibe in the Visual Arts and
              Design

            <p>
              Along with all of the development that I have been doing, I also
              enjoy digital design, digital art and digital music production. I
              have played several instruments and have arranged, composed and
              recorded a lot of my own personal, original music growing up.
              However, I had never really gotten into the DAW (digital audio
              workspace, music production software), and there is soo much to
              get into and so many possibilities in music production software. I
              eventually kept my interest going with digital music production
              including writing EDM and house music, and mixing and recording
              remixes. My favorite EDM music producers are Deadmau5, Illenium,
              Last Heroes, Seven Lions, The Chainsmokers and many other future
              bass production musicians and duos.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the outside world (not within my home, family or primary
              interests), few things have captivated my attention like branding,
              logos / logotype and visual design. Not only do I get completely
              entranced in an amazing logo design or brochure layout, but I have
              noticed that the billions of people around me do too. Logos and
              visual design are one of the biggest influences in the world. The
              successful production of a visual design, whether it is logo or
              product manifestation determines the current acceptance future and
              longevity of a business. A good, simple design can instantly
              attract customers and continue attracting new customers as the
              company grows and develops. A good name and good logo are
              paramount to any business. Name a business something cool and slap
              a cool logo on it, they are half way there to success (as long as
              they don&apos;t botch product, customer support or accounting).
              People slap stickers of random companies on the back of their car
              (which is pretty much the moving equivalent of their bedroom),
              just to make their car look cool. Branding and visual design have
              such a (sometimes subconsciously) influence in how humans see
              things around them, accept things, accept certain brands and keep
              businesses afloat with raving customers or who are abandoned for
              reasons that can&apos;t be physically justified (but were
              unknowingly, or reluctantly, pushing a poorly created, rushed or
              price-compromised, subconsciously un-cool design).
            </p>
            <p>
              My digital design experience and passion kicked in while I was a
              student at University. Along with our UX / UI and interaction
              design courses, we learned a lot of software for digital product
              design including Sketch, Adobe XD, Adobe InDesign, Photoshop,
              Illustrator and many other adobe products (and products that were
              made to compete with adobe, usually web-based software
              applications). I started dabbling in photoshop and illustrator,
              and although many of the software features are hidden behind a
              learning curve, my passion pushed my through until I got to the
              point where I could envision and create anything my imagination
              wanted to explore. Digital art is incredible fascinating and fun
              for me. And Digital Design has always been a huge part of my
              observations in the world around me. I am fascinated by good
              design, bad design and what makes people react to designs
              differently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I put a lot into the study of scientific and mathematical
              explanations for &quot;good design&quot;, and what mathematical
              equations were being used to instantly, visually attract users to
              a specific brand. I noticed that generally a person (whether
              versed in digital design or not) could see a piece of art of a
              digital design, and within a split second realize if that design
              was amazing or sub-standard. That type of reaction, being so quick
              and so vastly different, ignited a massive interest in me to learn
              more about what made good design. After thinking about it a lot,
              studying the most successful branding and most successful logo and
              logotype designs, I developed a sort of standard that has helped
              me design, develop and recognize good design around me. Much of
              that is built upon the Fibonacci Sequence, golden ratio or other
              names that that number sequence goes by. I became fascinated with
              numerical sequences and mathematics, and how these relative
              numbers and sequences could produce art that was both visually
              interesting and satisfying for the soul to look at. That is why
              the rule of thirds works and many other ratio, positioning and
              proportions work in art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from the theories of relative numerical sequencing and
              mathematic equations, I have also noticed that epic design
              sometimes just comes from something that looks cool. Mess around
              with something, use your vibe and creative touch, and just create
              according to you. What looks cool to you is what matters. Draw on
              things that have inspired you in the past and use some of those
              techniques to find your own creative style and vibe. That not only
              produces good results, it helps you enjoy what you are doing and
              will naturally have you coming back for more as you continue to
              explore your take on design, art and what looks good to you.
